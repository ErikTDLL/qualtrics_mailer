# qualtrics-mailer
A package for importing contact lists and distributing pre-built surveys in Qualtrics


"""
Users would like to better understand their customer sentiments on an on-going
basis. They therefore would like to regularly conduct satisfaction surveys (e.g.
NPS) using Qualtrics. They would like to avoid the manual process of preparing a
contact (e.g. mailing) list, importing it into Qualtrics and then scheduling a
survey to be distributed on a routine basis (daily/weekly/quarterly).
